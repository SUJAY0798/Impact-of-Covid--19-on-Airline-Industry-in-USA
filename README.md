The air transportation sector has come to a halt as a result of Covid-19. The goal of 
this study is to analyze the impact of pandemic on the U.S airline industry in all 
prospects. Airports are critical to a city's, nation's, or region's economic 
development. By providing services to airlines, moving people, and delivering 
cargo, they directly contribute to economies. Governments, consumers, and 
industries all gain from the unrestricted movement of products and people.
According to the research, there was a decline of almost 80% in the number of 
passengers flying in United States. This affected the airlines very severely which 
resulted in reduction of flights with a drop of 60%. With all these things the 
airlines economy dropped and so the government rolled out CARES Act in 
response to the financial fall out.
